# Introduction to Computer Programming

If you picked up this book, wherever it was you got it from, you deserve 'Tiri Gbosa' for yourself.
Let me do you the honor and say 'Gbosa', 'Gbosa', 'Gbosa'.
After the "Tiri Gbosa" we know that almost everyone has used a computer at one time or another. 
Perhaps you have coached for Django Girls or being a students of Django Girls or thinking of using computer to programme 
and moving inline of Python or used a computer before.
Computers are used to predict the design website, weather, design airplanes, make movies, run businesses, perform financial
transactions, and control factories. 
Have you ever stopped to wonder what exactly a computer is? 
How can one device perform so many different tasks? 
These basic questions are the starting point for learning about computers and computer programming.
